# Intro to C

## Purpose
    Subject to change as I'm not really sure what I want to do with this "project" yet, it'll probably stay
- basically just to learn, I guess
    - reteach myself C/C++ programming
        - eventually a game engine would be great
        - even a little game
    - better understanding of memory and low level
    - some shell scripting and better understanding of commands
    - ricing a GNU/Linux installation
    - eventually Cython? Idk I think its a cool idea but maybe its a dumpster file. I won't know til I try

## This is called "Intro to C "
    and I don't know how to change the name of this repo. However it is actually an intro for me. In case someone else finds this and wants to use it I suppose I'll try to make it so that it is readable for just a random passer-by, so its all gonna be a word salad

# GOALS:
- learn basic flow
    - input ouput in calculator
- ~~maybe do learn c the hard way~~ That costs money D: I'm a poor man
- game engine (maybe using C++)
    - following lazy foos tutorial for SDL
    - handmade hero
